# Agentic behavior

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) stands as a landmark in AI advancement over the past decade. While the capabilities of LLMs, like reasoning and understanding, are noteworthy, their full potential remains untapped. At the heart of LLMs lies agentic behavior. By tapping into their emergent skills and fostering an environment conducive to interaction, we can unlock the full prowess of models like GPT-4. ikigAI aims to empower LLMs beyond their inherent limitations by harnessing prompt engineering, vector databases, and API integrations. Agents apply logic and reason to influence their surroundings, be it through human interactions or tool usage. The LLM acts as the agent's cognitive core. This allows for the creation of dynamic agents by intertwining linguistic manipulation with a versatile API framework. Prompt engineering has proven effective against short-term memory and reasoning constraints. But, addressing long-term memory is more intricate. As updating the model isn't an option, an external storage system becomes imperative. Using LLMs to generate context-based summaries has its limitations, making vector databases an attractive solution.

Vector databases, particularly with the prowess of Pinecone, offer rapid querying of vast data records. Such databases enable LLMs to access and store extensive information, effectively simulating long-term memory. Note: Beyond prompt engineering and vector databases lies the challenge of agent interaction. APIs bridge this gap. Examples include:

- ElevenLabs: text-to-speech & Pro Voice Cloning.
- Google Search API: Web search and data retrieval.
- Hugging Face: Access to NLP models and transformers.
- MidJourney & Dall-E: Image generation from text.
- OpenAI's GPT API: Text generation using GPT-4.
- Llama-2-70b-chat: pre-trained and fine-tuned
- ChadGPT: Grammarly for Smart Contracts; WIP
- Trained with 169 smart contract vulnerabilities and fixes.

# Embeddings:

# Fine tuning

Fine-tuning for GPT-3.5 is a game-changer. Price is bit expensive though. It's 4.20 times more expensive than the base gpt3.5 model. Fine Tuning is dope AF. But models can only ever be as good as the data they are trained on. No matter how intelligent the LLM is, retrieving the wrong thing in context will surely lead to hallucinations. Garbage in, garbage out. Here are a few examples:

- Content Creation: 
Tailored for our LiveTheLifeTV Gen Art, Photography & Travel Magazine.

- Shopping Assistants: 
Designed to understand and respond to specific LTL product queries.

- Financial Analysis: 
Analyze real estate values, or the cryptocurrency industry.

- Creative Arts: 
Music composition and art design tools tailored for photography.

- Travel Assistants: 
Guides for curated regions, offering travel tips.

- Real Estate: 
Property suggestions near worldclass surf.

- Weather Forecasting: 
Detailed weather analyses for surfers or snowboarders.

TLDR: https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates

## In the era of permissionless systems, individuals can now exercise self-sovereignty over their data, empowering them with control and ownership. 

Between 2015 and 2017, pioneering endeavors surfaced, marking digital art and media on the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains. Come 2018, the ERC-721 token standard was set in stone, paving the way for a revolutionary web3-oriented creative economy centralized on the production and gathering of NFTs. This sparked a wave of innovation, birthing hundreds of marketplaces, mobilizing thousands of creators and aficionados, and ushering in millions of NFTs in the subsequent half-decade. onchain is the next online

# Provenance 

Our AI, powered by the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, can craft anything from engaging text to mesmerizing images and soulful music. But with great power comes the question: who truly owns these digital masterpieces? NFTs are our answer. With them, we can stamp a seal of originality on every AI-created piece, giving artists and creators the undisputed title to their digital works.

Art isn't just about expression; it's also about value. In a digital age where replication is just a click away, NFTs are our game-changers. They allow us to craft exclusive, limited-edition AI artworks. For artists and creators, this isn't just about standing out; it's an opportunity to monetize their genius, offering collectors a piece of digital rarity that may or may not appreciate in value.

Imagine a world where you can trade AI tools as you would collectible cards. With NFTs, that's our reality. We're setting the stage for a marketplace where AI models become tokens of trade. For researchers, developers, and innovators, this means more than just access; it's a space to collaborate, innovate, and even earn from their creations.
