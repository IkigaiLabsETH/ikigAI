# ikigAI studio training our CEO

In the era of permissionless systems, individuals can now exercise self-sovereignty over their data, empowering them with control and ownership. Code, at its core, is a medium through which ideas are expressed in the language of computers. While knowledge remains valuable, the advent of dedicated AI tools has shifted the emphasis towards critical thinking. These tools enable us to navigate vast amounts of information and extract meaningful insights, fostering a culture of innovation and problem-solving. In this new paradigm, the ability to think critically and creatively becomes paramount

## GPT4.20 + MJ V6.9

At ikigAI Labs XYZ, we have embarked on an exciting journey led by our visionary CEO, who is harnessing the power of AI to shape the future of our company in the next decade. With the help of a fine-tuned GPT4.20 model, our CEO is immersing himself in web3 knowledge, leveraging real-time data and cutting-edge art information obtained through API endpoints. For the past two decades, he has meticulously curated the top 1000 places to Live The Life, ensuring that our Artist Residency offerings are nothing short of exceptional. His passion for coding runs deep, as he firmly believes that code is the foundation of everything. By partnering with OpenAI, our CEO has accelerated his learning curve, allowing him to focus on the business logic and idea implementation that drive our success. This streamlined approach has expedited our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development. 

He indulges in his love for generative art code, photography, video editing, color grading, electronic music, and exploring the possibilities of MidJourney V6.9. These creative outlets allow him to seamlessly blend technology and artistic expression, pushing the boundaries of visual art through algorithms and code. This passion fuels his understanding of gen art, bringing a unique perspective to our endeavors at ikigAI Labs XYZ. In addition to his involvement in generative art, our CEO dedicates a significant portion of his time to writing content for our editorial magazine. He also actively engages with creators, fostering fair and transparent collaborations through contracts with esteemed organizations like Translient Lab, Manifold Studio and audited contracts powered by the Thirdweb SDK. Furthermore, he diligently indexes the top 1000 curated art collections using the Reservoir SDK. 

Staying ahead of the curve is paramount in the rapidly evolving world of web3. That's why our CEO leverages the power of the top 10 web3 APIs, keeping his finger on the pulse of the market. This strategic approach empowers him to make well-informed decisions and seize opportunities that align with our mission and vision.

## API GPT ROUTE.TS

This is an experimental project using OpenAI GPT Plugins and Replicate to combine all AI APis into one.

Instead of using separate interfaces for image generation, video generation, audio generation, and general text natural language processing, this app combines all of them together into a single prompt.

APIs currently supported:
- Text to image
- Text to video
- Text to audio
- General natural language processing

Examples of what you might ask:

- Create a 4 day travel itinerary for Paris.
- Create an image of someone in their production studio creating beats, futuristic, dim lighting, bronx new york
- Create a track that sounds like it might come from kanye west, hip-hop, soul samples, heavy drums, innovative melodies, experimental sounds, unusual effects, automation, modulating filters, distortion effects
- Create a video of clown fish swimming in a coral reef, beautiful, 8k, perfect, award winning, national geographic

# How: Leveraging the Power of Large Language Models

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) stands as a landmark in AI advancement over the past decade. While the capabilities of LLMs, like reasoning and understanding, are noteworthy, their full potential remains untapped.

At the heart of LLMs lies agentic behavior. By tapping into their emergent skills and fostering an environment conducive to interaction, we can unlock the full prowess of models like GPT-4. ikigAI aims to empower LLMs beyond their inherent limitations by harnessing prompt engineering, vector databases, and API integrations.

Agents apply logic and reason to influence their surroundings, be it through human interactions or tool usage. The LLM acts as the agent's cognitive core. This allows for the creation of dynamic agents by intertwining linguistic manipulation with a versatile API framework.

Prompt engineering has proven effective against short-term memory and reasoning constraints. But, addressing long-term memory is more intricate. As updating the model isn't an option, an external storage system becomes imperative. Using LLMs to generate context-based summaries has its limitations, making vector databases an attractive solution.

Vector databases, particularly with the prowess of Pinecone, offer rapid querying of vast data records. Such databases enable LLMs to access and store extensive information, effectively simulating long-term memory.

Beyond prompt engineering and vector databases lies the challenge of agent interaction. APIs bridge this gap. Examples include:

- ElevenLabs: text-to-speech & Pro Voice Cloning.
- Google Search API: Web search and data retrieval.
- Hugging Face: Access to NLP models and transformers.
- MidJourney & Dall-E: Image generation from text.
- OpenAI's GPT API: Text generation using GPT-4.

Combining API tools and prompt engineering, we can enhance agents' environmental interactions. Achieving consistent function calls from LLMs is a challenge that the ReAct framework and vector databases can address. With the release of gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613 by OpenAI, we can harness native function calls and JSON fine-tuning. This synergy of prompt methods, vector databases, and API tools supercharges any model.

# Embeddings and Their Application:

ChatGPT excels in general queries but struggles with web3-specific questions due to knowledge gaps and source citation issues. We address this with embeddings and vector search.

# Introducing Supabase:

Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, offers a swift backend setup. Within minutes, projects are equipped with authentication, a Postgres database, instant APIs, storage, and real-time subscriptions. With security at its core, it simplifies sign-ups and data protection. Users can manage extensive files effortlessly and run custom codes without server hassles. Supabase fosters local development, scaling as required.

# Why OpenAI Edge

A TypeScript module for querying OpenAI's API using `fetch` (a standard Web API)
instead of `axios`. This is a drop-in replacement for the official `openai`
module (which has `axios` as a dependency).

As well as reducing the bundle size, removing the dependency means we can query
OpenAI from edge environments. Edge functions such as Next.js Edge API Routes
are very fast and, unlike lambda functions, allow streaming data to the client.

The latest version of this module has feature parity with the official `v3.3.0`.

> **Update July 2023:** The official `openai` library will use `fetch` in v4,
> hopefully making `openai-edge` redundant. You can try it in beta now, more
> info here: https://github.com/openai/openai-node/discussions/182
V4 is out now! https://github.com/openai/openai-node/blob/v4/api.md
